Noah's Ark Printable Memory Game

## Rules

For the first game or younger players, start with all cards laid face up
on a table. Each player in turn identifies a pair (visible) and turns it
face down, leaving the cards in the same place. Once all the cards are
face down, the game can start using the regular rule below.

Each player turns two cards, trying to match a pair. If two identical
cards are turned, the player wins the pair and plays again immediately.
Otherwise, the cards are turned face down and the next player can play.
The game ends when all cards have been matched in pairs.

The game can be played in a collaborative way, all players sharing the
victory when all the pairs have been found, with or without a time limit.
Otherwise, the player who found the most pairs wins the game.

## Printing Instructions

The game is available either in color or in black and white,
for printing on A4 or US Letter paper. Cards in the A4 version
are 39mm in width, vs 38mm in the US Letter version.

Both versions feature 35 animals, with 35 distinct animals presented
on one page. The same sheet shall be printed twice to have pairs,
and each sheet shall be printed on both sides:

  * the front side has all the distinct animals (one card for each pair)
  * the back side has Noah's Ark (one back for each card)

In order to ensure that the front and back of each card match on the
printing page, define non-printable areas of 0mm/0in on each side and
print the page at full size (100%), with no resizing applied. Safe
margins ([greater than 0.25in](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3513476))
are already included in the PDF documents.

The cards are laid next to each other, without separating gutters.
Separate the cards by cutting along the middle lines between cards,
using the end of rounded borders (in black and white version) or the
difference of background color (in color version) as a visual indication
of the separation between cards. The cards can be left as squares, there
is no need to cut off the rounded corners.

## Illustration Credits

I selected silhouettes of animals and Noah's Ark
published by [The Noun Project][].

See the `pictures` folder for the full list of credits;
each picture contains the title of the picture and the author name,
as listed by [The Noun Project][], followed with the identifier of
the picture.

Some picture names are prefixed with a custom name, before a `-`,
which helps to identify the animal or improves sorting order.
